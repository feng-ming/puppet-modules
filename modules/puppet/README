= Sample Usage

Basic puppet client node :

    include puppet::client

More advanced puppet client node configuration to be set in site.pp :

    class { 'puppet::client':
        master => $hostname ? {
            'puppet' => true,
             default => false,
        },
        sysconfig => $operatingsystem ? {
            'Gentoo' => false,
             default => true,
        },
        forcenoop     => true,
        service       => false,
        cron_enable   => true,
        cron_silent   => true,
        puppet_server => 'puppet.example.com',
    }

The noop related options are especially useful for small deployments where
there is no testing environment but there is a Dashboard or similar, since
no changes will be automatically made, but all pending changes will appear
and be easy to review. The included "repuppet" scripts can then be run on
nodes where changes are to be applied.
