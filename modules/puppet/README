= Sample Usage

Basic puppet agent on a client node :

    include puppet::agent

More advanced puppet client node configuration to be set in site.pp :

    class { 'puppet::agent':
        sysconfig => $operatingsystem ? {
            'Gentoo' => false,
             default => true,
        },
        forcenoop     => true,
        service       => false,
        cron_enable   => true,
        cron_silent   => true,
        puppet_server => 'puppet.example.com',
    }

The noop related options are especially useful for small deployments where
there is no testing environment but there is a Dashboard or similar, since
no changes will be automatically made, but all pending changes will appear
and be easy to review. The included "repuppet" scripts can then be run on
nodes where changes are to be applied.

Example puppet master :

    class { 'puppet::master':
        runtype      => 'passenger',
        reports      => 'http',
        storeconfigs => true,
    }

When enabling the puppet::master class, the puppet::agent's main configuration
is then changed to be puppetagent.conf, and both it and a puppetmaster.conf
are automatically concatenated together as puppet.conf when either changes.

This is because it isn't trivial to use a different configuration for each.
