Simple xinetd module.

With a basic "include xinetd", the package is installed and the daemon enabled.

Definitions are available for the following :
 * Basic service enabling from an existing configuration snippet :

    xinetd::service { "rsync": }

 * Advanced template-based configuration snippet creation :

    xinetd::serviceconf { "vmstat":
        service_type => "UNLISTED",
        port         => "24101",
        user         => "nobody",
        server       => "/usr/bin/vmstat",
    }

Removing services is also supported :

    xinetd::serviceconf { "vmstat":
        server => "/usr/bin/vmstat",
        ensure => absent,
    }
