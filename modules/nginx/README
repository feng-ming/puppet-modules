nginx

Install, enable and configure an NGINX web server instance with its main
configuration file options as well as additional configuration snippets.

The module is very Red Hat Enterprise Linux focused, as the defaults try to
change everything in ways which are typical for RHEL, but it also works on
other distributions and is very easy to port if needed.

* `nginx` : Main class for the NGINX web server.
* `nginx::file` : Manage additional configuration snippets.
* `nginx::params` : Class to set distribution specific defaults.

# Sample Usage

    # Default server, with a typical minimal virtualhost
    # You'll want to use a real template to make it more readable
    include nginx
    $listen_http = [ '127.0.0.1:80', '192.168.0.12:80' ]
    nginx::file { 'www.example.com.conf':
        content => inline_template('# Sample configuration file
    server {
    <% listen_http.each do |listen_line| -%>
        listen <%= listen_line %>;
    <% end -%>
        server_name www.example.com;
        root /var/www/www.example.com;
    }
    '),
    }
