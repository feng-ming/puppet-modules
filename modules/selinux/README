selinux

Transparently create SELinux modules based on AVC denial messages, to easily
allow otherwise denied system operations.

* `selinux` : Main class which makes sure the basics are set up correctly.
* `selinux::audit2allow` : Definition to allow based on avc denial messages.

Example Usage :

    selinux::audit2allow { 'mydaemon': }
    selinux::audit2allow { 'myotherdaemon':
        source => "puppet:///files/${::fqdn}/selinux-messages",
    }

The content of the above files is based on kernel/audit avc denial messages.
See the included messages.nrpe file for an example.
