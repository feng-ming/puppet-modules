ipset

Manage IP sets in the Linux kernel. Support in Red Hat Enterprise Linux has
been introduced in the RHEL 6.2 kernel (run "modinfo ip_set" to check).

* `ipset` : Main definition to create and manage IP sets.
* `ipset::iptables` : Definition to manage IP set related iptables rules.
* `ipset::base` : Base class for the common parts.
* `ipset::params` : Base class for distribution specific parameters.

Once you have your IP sets in place, you'll want to manage iptables rules which
make use of those IP sets.
