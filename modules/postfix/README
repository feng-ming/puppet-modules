postfix

This module is meant for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and clones. It still requires
some major clean up, but is currently fully functional.

* `postfix::dbfile` : Manage Postfix DB configuration files
* `postfix::file` : Manage flat text Postfix configuration files
* `postfix::server` : Manage the main Postfix instance
