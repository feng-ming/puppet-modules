mailman

This module manages the main Mailman configuration. In addition, you will need
other modules to provide :
* The web server configuration needed for the web interface.
* The mail transport agent configuration needed to receive and send emails.

You can use the default puppet 'maillist' type to create and delete lists once
the instance is up and running.

* `mailman` : Configure the main Mailman instance
